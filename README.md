## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Create a new repository at github.com.(this is your repository)**

    Give it the same name as the this repository.

    Don't initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.

2.  **Clone this repository to your local machine.** (if you haven't done so already)

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Muzzu153/Al-RahmaHill.git
    ```

3.  **Rename the local repository's current 'origin' to 'upstream'**

    ```sh
    git remote rename origin upstream
    ```

4.  **Give the local repository an 'origin' that points to your repository.**

    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-account/Al-RahmaHill.git
    ```

5. **Push the local repository to your repository on github.**

    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```

6.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary packages.

    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

7.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary packages.

    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

8.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Add the following environment variables. You will need to create your own MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, and Cloudinary credentials.

    ```env
    # .env file in /backend

    MONGODB_URI = 'your_mongodb_connection_string'
    PORT = 4000
    SALT_ROUNDS = 10
    USER_JWT_SECRET= "your_super_secret_jwt_key"
    CLOUDINARY_NAME = 'your_cloudinary_cloud_name' 
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = 'your_cloudinary_api_key'
    CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY = 'your_cloudinary_api_secret'
    
    
    # .env file in /frontend
    VITE_BACKEND_URL = http://localhost:4000
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend` directory, run:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    The server will start on `http://localhost:4000` (or the port you specified).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    From the `frontend` directory, run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5175` (or the port you specified).
